**Kirei** (綺麗 jap. *pretty, clean, tidy*) is a basic open-source
[osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh) skin, built from the ground up in SVG.

Its main goal is to serve as an open, customizable starting point for further
modifications, without adding unnescessary visual noise. Its heavy use of SVG
embedding makes changing existing elements easy.
